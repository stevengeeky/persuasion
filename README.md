# Time Capsule Persuasion Presentation
This is a presentation slider that I made for my English class in my sophomore year of high school. My partner Garrett and I then used it to create a slideshow about five things that should be put in a time capsule for humans to rediscover later.

`register.php` is a remote for the slideshow which can be controlled on a phone or tablet, or just another tab ;)
